# Azure Task Manager: Cloud-Native Deployment ðŸš€

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project showcases the **deployment of a containerized Task Manager application** on **Microsoft Azure**, following DevOps best practices. It mirrors an **AWS ECS-based setup** but leverages **Azure Container Apps** for hosting and **Terraform for infrastructure provisioning**.  

The goal was to **package, build, and deploy** the application while implementing **CI/CD, security, and scalability**.  

**This README provides an overview of the deployment process, highlighting key decisions, trade-offs, and implementation details.**

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- **Containerized App Deployment** using **Azure Container Apps**  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform**  
- **Container Image Management** using **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**  
- **CI/CD Automation** with **GitHub Actions**  
- **Secure HTTPS Routing** using **Azure Front Door / Application Gateway**
